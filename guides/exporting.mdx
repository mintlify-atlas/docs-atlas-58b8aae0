description: Export your markdown documents to .md files for use in other applications
---

CodeInk allows you to export any document as a standard Markdown (.md) file that works with any markdown-compatible application.

## Quick Export

Export your current document with a single click:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Document">
    Navigate to the document you want to export in the editor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Export Button">
    Click the **MD** button (with download icon) in the header toolbar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save File">
    Your browser's download dialog appears - choose where to save the file
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The export button is located in the header toolbar, right next to the view mode buttons.
</Tip>

## Export Implementation

Here's how CodeInk exports documents:

```typescript
export function setupMarkdownExport(signal: AbortSignal) {
  const exportMdBtn = document.getElementById("export-md")
  if (!exportMdBtn) return

  exportMdBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    // Get current editor content
    const content = getEditorContent()
    
    // Extract title from first H1 heading
    const titleMatch = content.match(/^#\s+(.+)$/m)
    const title = titleMatch ? titleMatch[1].trim() : "document"
    
    // Sanitize title for filename
    const sanitized = title
      .replace(/[^a-z0-9\u00e1\u00e9\u00ed\u00f3\u00fa\u00fc\u00f1\s-]/gi, "")
      .replace(/\s+/g, "-")
    const filename = `${sanitized}.md`

    // Create and download file
    const blob = new Blob([content], { type: "text/markdown;charset=utf-8" })
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
    const link = document.createElement("a")
    link.href = url
    link.download = filename
    document.body.appendChild(link)
    link.click()
    document.body.removeChild(link)
    URL.revokeObjectURL(url)
  }, { signal })
}
```

## Filename Generation

CodeInk automatically generates smart filenames based on your document content:

### Title Extraction

The filename is extracted from the first H1 heading in your document:

```markdown
# My Project Documentation

Content here...
```

**Exported as**: `My-Project-Documentation.md`

<Note>
  If your document doesn't have an H1 heading, the file will be named `document.md`.
</Note>

### Sanitization Rules

Filenames are sanitized to ensure compatibility:

1. **Allowed Characters**:
   - Letters: `a-z`, `A-Z`
   - Numbers: `0-9`
   - Accented characters: `á`, `é`, `í`, `ó`, `ú`, `ü`, `ñ`
   - Hyphens: `-`

2. **Removed Characters**:
   - Special characters: `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, etc.
   - Punctuation: `:`, `;`, `?`, `!`, etc.
   - Symbols: `&`, `*`, `+`, `=`, etc.

3. **Space Conversion**:
   - All spaces become hyphens: ` ` → `-`
   - Multiple spaces collapse to single hyphen: `  ` → `-`

### Example Transformations

| Document Title | Exported Filename |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `Getting Started Guide` | `Getting-Started-Guide.md` |
| `API: Documentation v2.0` | `API-Documentation-v20.md` |
| `How to use CodeInk?` | `How-to-use-CodeInk.md` |
| `Feature #123: Export` | `Feature-123-Export.md` |
| (no heading) | `document.md` |

## Export Format

### What's Exported

The exported file contains the **complete raw markdown** from the editor, including:

<Check>
  - All headings and text
  - Code blocks with language tags
  - Lists (ordered and unordered)
  - Links and images
  - Tables
  - Blockquotes
  - HTML comments
  - Mermaid diagram code
  - KaTeX math expressions
  - Horizontal rules
  - Task lists
</Check>

### What's Not Exported

<Warning>
  The export is **plain markdown only**. These items are not included:
  - Rendered HTML
  - Custom CSS styling
  - CodeInk metadata (document ID, timestamps, custom title)
  - Preview rendering state
</Warning>

### File Characteristics

- **Format**: Plain text markdown
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Line Endings**: Preserved from editor (typically LF on Unix-like systems, CRLF on Windows)
- **MIME Type**: `text/markdown;charset=utf-8`

## Using Exported Files

Your exported markdown files work with any markdown-compatible application:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Version Control" icon="git">
    Commit to Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Static Site Generators" icon="file-code">
    Use with Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documentation Tools" icon="book">
    Import into Docusaurus, MkDocs, GitBook, Mintlify
  </Card>
  <Card title="Note-Taking Apps" icon="note-sticky">
    Open in Obsidian, Notion, Bear, Typora, or any markdown editor
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Browser Download Behavior

When you click the export button, your browser handles the download:

### Chrome / Edge
- File downloads to your default Downloads folder
- Notification appears at bottom of browser
- Click notification to open file or folder

### Firefox
- Dialog appears asking where to save
- Option to remember choice for `.md` files
- Downloads to chosen location

### Safari
- File downloads to Downloads folder
- Download icon appears in toolbar
- Click to view downloaded files

<Tip>
  Configure your browser's download settings to choose where files are saved or to always prompt for location.
</Tip>

## Export Button UI

The export button is styled consistently with other toolbar buttons:

```astro
<button 
  id="export-md" 
  type="button" 
  aria-label="Export as Markdown" 
  title="Export as Markdown"
>
  <svg><!-- download icon --></svg>
  <span class="hidden sm:inline">MD</span>
</button>
```

### Button Features

- **Icon**: Download arrow pointing down
- **Label**: "MD" (visible on desktop)
- **Tooltip**: "Export as Markdown" on hover
- **Responsive**: Icon-only on mobile

## Technical Details

### Blob Creation

CodeInk uses the Blob API to create the file:

```typescript
const blob = new Blob([content], { 
  type: "text/markdown;charset=utf-8" 
})
```

This creates a binary large object containing your markdown text with proper encoding.

### Object URL

A temporary URL is created for the download:

```typescript
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
```

This URL is valid only for the current page session and is revoked after download to free memory:

```typescript
URL.revokeObjectURL(url)
```

### Download Trigger

The download is triggered by creating a temporary link element:

```typescript
const link = document.createElement("a")
link.href = url
link.download = filename
document.body.appendChild(link)
link.click()
document.body.removeChild(link)
```

This programmatic approach works in all modern browsers without user interaction beyond the initial button click.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Descriptive H1 Headings" icon="heading">
    Start your document with a clear H1 heading to generate a meaningful filename.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Export Before Major Edits" icon="floppy-disk">
    Create a backup by exporting before making significant changes to your document.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Organize Downloads" icon="folder">
    Create folders for exported documents to keep them organized by project or topic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Version Control" icon="code-branch">
    For important documents, export to a Git repository to track changes over time.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Backup Important Work

Export documents regularly to create backups outside of your browser:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export Document">
    Click the MD button to download your document
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save to Cloud Storage">
    Move the exported file to Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue Editing">
    Keep working in CodeInk with peace of mind
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Share with Collaborators

Send markdown files to team members who use different tools:

- Export the document
- Share via email, Slack, or other messaging
- Recipients can open in their preferred markdown editor

### 3. Publish to GitHub

Export documents for use in GitHub repositories:

```bash
# After exporting
mv ~/Downloads/API-Documentation.md ./docs/
git add docs/API-Documentation.md
git commit -m "Add API documentation"
git push
```

### 4. Import to CMS

Many content management systems accept markdown:

- Export from CodeInk
- Upload to your CMS or static site generator
- Publish to your website

## Limitations

<Warning>
  **No Batch Export**: CodeInk exports one document at a time. To export multiple documents, visit each document and click the export button individually.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **No Auto-Export**: Export is manual only. If you need automatic backups, consider using a script to periodically export from IndexedDB.
</Warning>

## Future Export Options

While CodeInk currently only exports to markdown, here are some potential future export formats:

- **PDF**: Export rendered preview as PDF
- **HTML**: Export as standalone HTML file
- **DOCX**: Export to Microsoft Word format
- **Batch Export**: Export all documents as a ZIP file

## Comparison with Auto-Save

| Feature | Auto-Save | Export |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Location** | Browser IndexedDB | File system |
| **Trigger** | Automatic (1s after typing) | Manual (button click) |
| **Format** | JSON (structured data) | Plain markdown text |
| **Portability** | Browser-specific | Universal |
| **Backup** | Limited to browser | Full control |
| **Sharing** | Not shareable | Easy to share |

<Tip>
  Use auto-save for working drafts and export for backups, sharing, and publishing.
