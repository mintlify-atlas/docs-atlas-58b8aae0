---

CodeInk supports GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) extensions, giving you access to alerts, tables, footnotes, task lists, and automatic heading IDs.

## GitHub-Style Alerts

Create styled callout boxes using the GitHub alert syntax:

### Alert Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NOTE">
    ```markdown
    > [!NOTE]
    > Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.
    ```
    
    **Rendered as:**
    > [!NOTE]
    > Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="TIP">
    ```markdown
    > [!TIP]
    > Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.
    ```
    
    **Rendered as:**
    > [!TIP]
    > Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="IMPORTANT">
    ```markdown
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.
    ```
    
    **Rendered as:**
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="WARNING">
    ```markdown
    > [!WARNING]
    > Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.
    ```
    
    **Rendered as:**
    > [!WARNING]
    > Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="CAUTION">
    ```markdown
    > [!CAUTION]
    > Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
    ```
    
    **Rendered as:**
    > [!CAUTION]
    > Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Implementation

Alerts are rendered via the `marked-alert` extension:

```typescript src/lib/markdown.ts
import markedAlert from "marked-alert"

marked.use(markedAlert())
```

<Info>
  Alert syntax is identical to GitHub's markdown rendering, ensuring compatibility with your existing documentation.
</Info>

## Tables

Create tables using pipe syntax:

```markdown
| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |
```

**Rendered as:**

| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |

### Alignment

Control column alignment with colons:

```markdown
| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Left         | Center         | Right         |
| Text         | Text           | Text          |
```

**Rendered as:**

| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Left         | Center         | Right         |
| Text         | Text           | Text          |

## Footnotes

Add footnotes to provide additional context without cluttering the main text:

```markdown
Here's a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

Another sentence with a footnote.[^2]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^2]: This is the second footnote with more details.
```

**Rendered as:**

Here's a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

Another sentence with a footnote.[^2]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^2]: This is the second footnote with more details.

### Implementation

Footnotes are rendered via the `marked-footnote` extension:

```typescript src/lib/markdown.ts
import markedFootnote from "marked-footnote"

marked.use(markedFootnote())
```

<Tip>
  Footnotes are automatically numbered and linked. Click a footnote reference to jump to its definition.
</Tip>

## Task Lists

Create interactive checkboxes for task tracking:

```markdown
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Uncompleted task
- [ ] Another task to do
```

**Rendered as:**

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Uncompleted task
- [ ] Another task to do

<Note>
  Task lists in CodeInk are visual only. Checking/unchecking boxes requires editing the markdown source.
</Note>

## Auto-Linked Headings

All headings automatically receive IDs based on their text content, making them linkable:

```markdown
## My Awesome Heading

This heading gets the ID: #my-awesome-heading
```

### Implementation

Heading IDs are generated via `marked-gfm-heading-id`:

```typescript src/lib/markdown.ts
import { gfmHeadingId } from "marked-gfm-heading-id"

marked.use(gfmHeadingId())
```

<Tip>
  Use heading IDs to create internal document links: `[Jump to section](#my-awesome-heading)`
</Tip>

## Strikethrough

Strike through text using double tildes:

```markdown
~~This text is struck through~~
```

**Rendered as:**

~~This text is struck through~~

## Automatic URL Linking

URLs are automatically converted to clickable links:

```markdown
Visit https://codeink.app for more info
```

**Rendered as:**

Visit https://codeink.app for more info

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use alerts strategically" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Don't overuse alerts. Reserve them for truly important information.

  <Card title="Keep tables simple" icon="table">
    Complex tables can be hard to read. Consider breaking them into multiple tables.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Number footnotes logically" icon="1">
    Use sequential numbering for footnotes to maintain readability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test task lists" icon="check">
    Preview your task lists to ensure proper formatting before exporting.
